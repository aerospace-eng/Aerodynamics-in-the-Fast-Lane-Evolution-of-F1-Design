Fast, low, and glued to the track — a deep dive into the aerodynamic mastery behind Formula 1 cars.
# 🏎️ Aerodynamics in the Fast Lane: Evolution of F1 Design

Formula 1 is more than just the pinnacle of motorsport — it's a high-speed laboratory where the limits of engineering and innovation are tested every season. Each car on the grid is not just a machine of speed, but the product of thousands of hours of design, simulation, and refinement. At the heart of this relentless pursuit of performance lies one of the most critical elements of modern F1: **aerodynamics**.

This project explores the evolution of aerodynamic design in Formula 1 cars — from the ground-effect machines of the 1970s to today’s highly refined airflow management systems. We will examine how technological innovation, combined with ever-changing regulations, has shaped the way F1 cars cut through the air and stick to the track.

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is to analyze how the aerodynamic structures of F1 cars have evolved over the decades, and how these changes have affected performance in terms of speed, grip, and efficiency. It also looks into how FIA regulations have influenced engineering decisions throughout this evolution.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Inside

- Core aerodynamic principles (downforce, drag, DRS, and more)
- Technical analysis of iconic cars from different F1 eras
- The impact of rule changes on aerodynamic philosophy
- Year-by-year comparison of key performance data
- Basic visualizations and data charts
- Insights into future trends in F1 car design
